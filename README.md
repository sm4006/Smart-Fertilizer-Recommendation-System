# 🌾 Smart Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

A smart AI-based system that recommends the **best crop** and **required fertilizer** using soil and environmental data.



## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often apply fertilizers without knowing exact soil nutrient requirements, leading to low yield and soil damage.



## 💡 Solution
This system uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to:
- Recommend the most suitable **crop**
- Suggest required **fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP)** based on soil nutrients



## ⚙️ Input Parameters
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil pH
- Rainfall



## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn  
- Random Forest Algorithm  
- GitHub  



## 📊 Dataset
- Crop_recommendation.csv  
- Contains soil and weather parameters with crop labels



## 🔄 Working Flow
1. User enters soil and weather values  
2. ML model predicts best crop  
3. System checks nutrient deficiency  
4. Fertilizer recommendation is generated  



## ▶️ Example Output
Recommended Crop: Pomegranate
Fertilizer Advice: Nitrogen is low → Add Urea | Phosphorus is low → Add DAP
